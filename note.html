				<h2>Following topic covers in Class-7</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>CSS Layout: Layout is desined by HTML and CSS. We will use Float for now. Grid and Flex will learn during bootstrap.</li>
						
					<li>Create a header division: assign class and apply properties background color to view and must have to give <span>heigth</span> or content to show on page. <span>Width</span> 100% will automatically take as block level element. <span>Width</span> only applicable if want to minimize the width<br>
						<span>Height</span> versus <span>min-height</span>: 
						<ul>
							<li>if height not set, it automatically take as content required
							<li>If heigth set lower than content required space then background will show only as setted heigh even if content require more. Use of height is not profesional.
							<li>minimum-height will always show a background as minimum height set but atomatically increase as content required. If we want to height then minimum-height is best... mostly avaoid any height
							<li>maximum-height will allow only upto a setted height
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Wrappe concept: used when two div want to place same line. also known as container. We have to assign main and side division under wrapper division.</li>
					<li>Assign <span>background-color</span> in both side and main to understand.</li>
					<li>Assign <span>width</span> to body 70% and side as 25%. we have to some space form 100%. Becauseit will make some problem during taking space... after complete we can fill the gap by resizing <span>width</span>.</li>
					<li>Both division will show as <span>width</span> assign. Now we have apply float to both as <span>float:left</span> for main and <span>float:right</span> for side_box to set them in same line.</li>
					<li>Now a problem will arise, that next content will go in that 5% gap. So we have to use any of those option
						<ul>
						<li><span>overflow</span>: hidden in immidiate paranet class. Best option, becasue it will use full area of this division. and clear option will only restict next element go up.
						<li><span>clear</span>:both/left/right kit can be used in immidiate nex div to not use that gap.
							<ul>
								<li>clear: left will slove only left side
								<li>clear: right will slove only right side
								<li>clear: both will slove only both side
							</ul>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>For more than two content in same line we have to use float:left in all content.</li>
					<li><span>&#60;b&#62;</span>(only bold) and <span>&#60;strong&#62;</span>(blod and importance) looks similar but there are some differene in bowser and SEO.</li>
					<li><span>&#60;i&#62;</span> and <span>&#60;em&#62;</span> also same.</li>
					<li>iframe: (inline element) used to show external wesite element or full external website on a page. It's depends on external website permission. Youtube has permission to use youtube go to share and copy embed code.</li>
					<li>Google map integration: Go to Google map > mark a place > Share place > Embed amp > Copy iframe code > Paste in your html.</li>
